# Morphosource Batch Upload FHL Version
This is a repository of scripts used to upload CT scans on to MorphoSource.org at Friday Harbor Labs. The code uploaded here is a version of the original CT Tools script written by Natasha Vitek and tweaked by the Jennifer Gardner. Natasha's original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/nsvitek/CT_tools). My modified scripts are specific to the scans done at Friday Harbor Labs but the capabilities to be used for uploading specimens from any collection. I have also implemented a few features not currently available in Natasha's version. Full SOP coming soon.
