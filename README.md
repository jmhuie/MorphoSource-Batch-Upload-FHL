# Morphosource Batch Upload FHL Version
This is a repository of scripts used to upload CT scans on to MorphoSource.org at Friday Harbor Labs. The code uploaded here is a modified version of the original CT Tools script written by Natasha Vitek and by Jennifer Gardner. Natasha's original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/nsvitek/CT_tools). There is also a rename script to rename image stack files initially written by Jennifer Garnder and edited by me. My modified scripts are specific to the scans done at Friday Harbor Labs but have the capabilities to be used for uploading specimens from any collection. I have also implemented a few features not currently available in Natasha's version. Full SOP coming soon.
